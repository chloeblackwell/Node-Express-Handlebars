# burger

For this assingment, we were tasked to make an application with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebar and ORM. The application lets a user input a burger and once they submit the burger it displays the burger on the left hand side with a devour button. Once the burger has been devoured, it moves the burger to the right hand side.
